                    Although Nicholas is not currently employed, he receives VA
                disability benefits. His previous career saw him
                in a physically demanding and high-risk role, climbing cell
                towers. Starting as a green hand, his
                determination and skill propelled him to the position of foreman
                before he decided to leave the industry.
                This experience not only honed his leadership abilities but also
                reinforced his resilience and capacity for
                hard work.

                resilience is complemented by his belief in the power
                of confidence, inspired by Packnett's assertion that confidence
                is the precursor to success in all
                endeavors.

                    Nicholas is also guided by the inspirational words of Jack

                side of fear." This quote resonates deeply with him, serving as
                a constant reminder to push through fears
                and obstacles to achieve his dreams.
